# Consumers rate limiter

[Subscribing user guide](/user/subscribing) presents an overview of Consumers adaptive rate limiting algorithm.
This section describes the algorithm in detail along with all configuration options that can be used
to fine-tune it.

Measurement window for each subscription is *LIMITER_PERIOD* seconds. Each *LIMITER_PERIOD* seconds recalculation of
output rate is triggered. There are three algorithm phases (modes), by default subscription is started in **normal mode**:

* if there were no more than *SPEEDUP_TOLERANCE*% of failures, increase sending speed by *CONVERGENCE_FACTOR*%
* if there was more than *SPEEDUP_TOLERANCE*% failures, but no more than *TOLERANCE*%, don't change output rate
* if there was more than *TOLERANCE*% failures, decrease speed by *CONVERGENCE_FACTOR*%
* if there was more than 50% of failures, enter **slow mode**

In **slow mode** requests are sent each *SLOW_DELAY* seconds:

* if all requests were successful, enter **normal mode**
* if more than 50% of requests was successful, do nothing
* if more than 50% of requests failed, enter **heartbeat mode**

In **heatbeat mode** requests are sent each *HEARTBEAT_DELAY* seconds:

* if all requests were successful, enter **slow mode**
* if there were any failures, do nothing

Each of parameters written in capital letters can be configured:

## Maximum rate negotiation

The rate limit is applied to a particular data center and tries to divide the rate among assigned consumers.
It tries to work on the basis of consumers' needs by tracking actual delivery rate.
Use *ALGORITHM*=**negotiated** to enable it (that's the default).

A deprecated algorithm is also available (although not recommended), which works as follows:
if your hermes cluster runs N consumers per subscription (in all data centers), the maximum global rate
for this subscription will be divided as *{subscriptionPolicy.rate} / N*
for each consumer (*ALGORITHM*=**strict**). This algorithm should be avoided, as it changes the rate limit semantics
to be global instead of data center based.

### How the negotiated algorithm works

By tracking latest *RATE_HISTORY_SIZE* *DELIVERY_ATTEMPT_RATE* samples,
the algorithm is able to determine busy and non-busy consumers and balance the available global rate among them over time.

- *DELIVERY_ATTEMPT_RATE* = sent_attempts / *CONSUMER_MAX_RATE*
- We consider a consumer to be busy if it's *DELIVERY_ATTEMPT_RATE* > 1 - *BUSY_TOLERANCE*
and we try to take away a bit of rate from others.
- We don't bother do adjust more than *MIN_CHANGE_PERCENT*
and we always preserve a *MIN_MAX_RATE* for a consumer.
- Recalculation is done every *BALANCE_INTERVAL* seconds.
- Consumer updates it's delivery attempt rate history every *UPDATE_INTERVAL*
if the change from previous recorded value is greater than *MIN_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_PERCENT*.
- *MIN_SIGNIFICANT_CHANGE_PERCENT* / 100 must be lower than *BUSY_TOLERANCE*, as otherwise 
consumers would (in some cases) not enter busy state
- At the moment *RATE_HISTORY_SIZE* is ignored, defaulting to 1,
and might be used in future versions of the algorithm
