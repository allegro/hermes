/**
    Kafka producer maintains a single connection to each broker, over which produce request are sent.
    When producer request duration exceeds requestTimeout, producer closes the connection to the broker
    that the request was sent to. This causes all inflight requests that were sent to that broker to be cancelled.
    The number of inflight requests is configured by maxInflightRequestsPerConnection property.

    Let's assume that we have requestTimeout set to 500ms, maxInflightRequestsPerConnection set to 5,
    and there are following inflight batches in the producer being sent to broker1:

    batchId   | time spent in send buffer (socket)
    ------------------------------------
    batch1    | 10ms
    batch2    | 200ms
    batch3    | 300ms
    batch4    | 400ms
    batch5    | 501ms

    Batch5 exceeded the requestTimeout so producer will close the connection to broker1. This causes batch5 to be marked
    as failed but also causes batches 1-4 to be retried. This has the following consequences:
    1. Batches 1-4 will probably get duplicated - even tough they were cancelled, they were probably sent to the broker,
     just haven't been ACKd yet. Retry would cause them to be sent once again resulting in duplicates.
    2. On retry, batches 1-4 will have a smaller time budget to complete. Part of their budget was already wasted
    in send buffer + retryBackoff will be applied to them. They will have little time to complete on retry which can cause
    them to be timed out, potentially resulting in a vicious circle.
    3. Connection to the broker must be reestablished which takes time.

    To avoid problems described above we actually set requestTimeout and deliveryTimeout to be much higher than the
    maximum frontend request duration (frontend.handlers.maxPublishRequestDuration). This means that when
    maxPublishRequestDuration is exceeded for a message we received, a client will receive 5xx even tough the
    corresponding message is still being processed in the producer. The message will eventually be ACKd by Kafka so upon client-side
    retry the message will be duplicated. This however, would likely also happen if the message was promptly timed-out by producer
    before maxPublishRequestDuration elapsed - the message was likely already sent to Kafka, there just haven't been a response yet.

    So by using large requestTimeout we cause the first slow message to be duplicated (by client-side retry) but:
    - we protect other inflight messages from being duplicated,
    - we prevent connections from being frequently dropped and reestablished.
